I do not really know what I was supposed to do here... 
The design is quite shitty, no responsivness, but I think it is enough to show the behaivour of the functions and the knowledge of creating a "dynamic" site.

IMPORTANT
	- In order to show again all the films write "ALL" in the search field.
	- No Film Named "ALL" / "all" / "All" / etc. is allowed, as it is a reserved word to show all the films.

NOTES:
	- The overflow is made on porpose. (ONLY for the films Section)
	- If it is needed to improve the design just tell me.
		- Some margins and padding are missing
		- Colors should be carefully selected
		- Responsivness should be added
		- Code should be "cleaned"
